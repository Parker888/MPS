### Snowplow is an enterprise-strength marketing and product analytics platform. It does three things:

Identifies your users, and tracks the way they engage with your website or application
Stores your users' behavioral data in a scalable "event data warehouse" you control: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake or Elasticsearch
Lets you leverage the biggest range of tools to analyze that data, including big data tools (e.g. Spark) via EMR or more traditional tools e.g. Looker, Mode, Superset, Re:dash to analyze that behavioral data
To find out more, please check out the Snowplow website and the docs website.

## Version Compatibility Matrix
For compatibility assurance, the version compatibility matrix offers clarity on our recommended stack. It is strongly recommended when setting up a Snowplow pipeline to use the versions listed in the version compatibility matrix which can be found within our docs.

## Public Roadmap
This repository also contains the Snowplow Public Roadmap. The Public Roadmap lets you stay up to date and find out what's happening on the Snowplow Platform. Help us prioritize our cards: open the issue and leave a üëç to vote for your favorites. Want us to build a feature or function? Tell us by heading to our Discourse forum üí¨.

## Try Snowplow
Setting up a full open-source Snowplow pipeline requires a non-trivial amount of engineering expertise and time investment. You might be interested in finding out what Snowplow can do first, by setting up Try Snowplow.

## Open Source Quick Start
The Open Source Quick Start will help you get up and running with a Snowplow open source pipeline. Snowplow publishes a set of terraform modules, which automate the setting up & deployment of the required infrastructure & applications for an operational Snowplow open source pipeline, with just a handful of input variables required on your side.

Note: this is only available on AWS currently, GCP is coming soon!

Our Commercial Offering
If you wish to get everything setup and managed for you, you can consider Snowplow Insights. You can also request a demo.

We welcome all questions and contributions!

### Twitter
@SnowplowData for official news or @SnowplowLabs for engineering-heavy conversations and release updates.

### GitHub
If you spot a bug, then please raise an issue in the GitHub repository of the component in question. Likewise if you have developed a cool new feature or an improvement, please open a pull request, we'll be glad to integrate it in the codebase!

If you want to brainstorm a potential new feature, then Discourse is the best place to start.
